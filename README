I write quite a few console apps: utilities (of course), one-off tools, 
proof-of-concept apps, speed-tests of isolated algorithms, whatever.  
(Powershell and xUnit have whittled away at most of my needs for console apps,
but occassionally nothing else will do.)

I find myself slapping together, over and over again, snippets to do
the same basic functions for these apps.  Thought it was time to collect
these in one place.

Mostly, though, it's just an excuse to play with 'git submodule' :-)

The sub-directories contain the following simple snippets:

	Arguments	-- A ProgramArguments implementation allowing
	         	   defining and parsing of bool and name/value
	         	   command-line arguments, including basic
	         	   help-text formatting about the args.

	         	   The expected use is to sub-class ProgramArguments
	         	   so you can add strongly-typed, intellisense'd
	         	   property-names atop the base-class primitives.

	Std Pipes	-- Functions that ease the choice of file- or 
	        	   stdin/stdout text streams, including
	         	   encoding- and LF/CRLF-detection, 
	         	   determining if newline is needed prior to append,
	         	   and a simplistic IEnumerable<string> atop ReadLine.

	Logging   	-- An ExceptionHandler that walks the InnerException
	          	   chain for you, emits the stacktrace of the outer-most throw,
	        	   formats it for display or logging.

	Csv        	-- Basic enumeration of lines from delimited files.

	

These were all cobbled together to give minimal functionality to 
(predominantly throw-away) apps, so they've no polish whatsoever,
just quick-n'-dirty scaffolding for common needs.
